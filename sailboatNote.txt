sailboat note
boat can go into the wind by arodynamics
lift? keel?keel deas with the side way
lower pressure when fluid goes around
high pressure try to go to the low pressure side
bernully's principle
sailboat be lifted or sucked
mostly to the side but mostly forwards, sideway producing the majority of the power
trimming?

can't angle too much, if so, it will slow down the sail

main idea, keel and sail forces cancel each other out in different direction

two saild work together to make it faster
if overtrim the headsaw, the boat bearaway,
if overtrim the mainsaw, the boat tend to leftfar? leftoff?

avoid sitting and standing in the slot......
genoa. controlled by the direction.
less tension on the left.
telltail breaking evenly???
if the upper telltail is faster move the carb forward
if the lower telltail is faster move the carb backward

Halyard

forward stride as straight as possible

point the traveler as high as possible

possible issues:
there are two telltails on the sailboat normally but we only have 1 windsensor?


make marks on the elliot, car position and the sheets, to reproduce the condition at
another time

genoa, require less power in the still water
deepen the sail with strong wind
tension on the genoa
depower the genoa, lose the slot?
leach line tension need to be right

spiningker, is used to turn?
-----------------------------------------upwind
control of the sail:
1.main elliott, black ban of the mask??(we don't have it)
2.outhaul, backban?
3.vang, control the twist of the sail(don't have it)
4.mainsheet*1
5.1 sail.......

adjusting balance control:
1.traveler(don't have it)
2.cunningham

extra control:
1. foot outhaul
2. left cunningham

catamaran
sensor:
watching the boat speed, watching the helm, watch the telltail

---------------------------------------downwind
drop the spinninaker
sanicol not in a verticle plane, the main sheet collaps

raising the pole?

need to stabalize the spinninaker

pole should be set 90 degree to the mast to project the greatest area possible

there are multiple types of spinnakers

-----------------------------------
bearaway, need to lease the tension of the back mast



-----------------current boat
